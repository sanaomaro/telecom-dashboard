📡 Telecom Network Performance Dashboard
Interactive, modular Streamlit application for visualizing, analyzing, and modeling cellular network performance data.

<!-- Add your image link here if hosted -->

✨ Features
✅ Clean, modular Python code (organized by app/ folder)
✅ Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time filtering and analysis
✅ Data visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
✅ Outlier detection using rule-based logic and machine learning
✅ Regression analysis for signal strength modeling
✅ Random Forest SNR prediction model
✅ Supports CSV-based telecom datasets

📊 Example Outputs
Visuals from the working dashboard:

📈 Quick Network Summary: Signal strength, critical area counts, worst tower detection

🌐 Call Distribution: Call type breakdown by environment

📉 Signal Strength vs. SNR scatter plots with filtering options

🚨 Outlier Detection: Total anomalies across network performance

📏 Propagation Modeling: Signal loss vs distance & attenuation

📊 Tower Statistics: Performance metrics for each tower

🔮 SNR Prediction: Machine Learning model results

📅 SNR Trends: Daily signal quality trends over time
